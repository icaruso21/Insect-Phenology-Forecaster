### Thermal Ecology and Phenology

For many organisms, temperature has a significant influence on  **phenology**— the timing of important life events in the natural world (e.g. bird migrations, trees budding, and juvinile insects reaching adulthood). For years, scientists around the world have carefully documented  **phenological shifts**— interannual changes in the timing of phenological events— as a product of climate change. For example, deciduous trees are producing new leaves  [earlier in the year](https://www.usanpn.org/files/LeafOutHighlightChange_Arnoldia_.pdf),  because springtime temperatures continually occur sooner in the year. This kind of research often relies heavily on historic phenological records, which allow researchers to track changes in the timing of events of interest from one year to the next, and compare these shifts with climate data collected over the corresponding period of time.

Temperature is an especially influential factor in the lives of  **ectotherms**, animals whose body temperatures aren’t controlled internally but are strongly dependent on their surrounding environments. For example, insects tend to be slower-moving in cool conditions and more active when it’s warmer, because temperatures determine their  **metabolic rates**—  the speeds at which the chemical reactions that take place in cells to sustain life occur. Notably, these chemical reactions include the conversion of food to energy for use in various life processes including development. Insects inhabiting highly seasonal environments like mountains face a unique challenge in intensly variable. climatic conditions. Some months are subzero and snowcapped, while others remain hot with high, prolonged levels of solar radiation. Montane grasshoppers, for instance, spend months in a state of dormancy called  **diapause**, and can only feed and grow during the summer. They begin the growing season as eggs (laid the previous year) and spent the winter buried beneath the snow. Finally, after the completion of five juvenile  **instars**  (stages), the insects reach adulthood. If this does not occur before the arrival of autumn’s chill, the montane grasshopper is unable to reproduce. In this context, summer temperatures act as a powerful signal driving  **developmental phenology**— when these insects hatch and how fast they mature.
