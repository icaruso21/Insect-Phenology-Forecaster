## Common fruit fly <br><sup>*Drosophila melanogaster*</sup>

_D. melanogaster_ is a damaging pest of many fleshy fruits including cherries and grapes. It acts as a vector for many organisms causing sour rot, and in the summer, the common fruit fly's life cycle is only 7 to 8 days with productive adults laying up to 800 eggs every ~25 days. 

More information about this species (management, life-cycle, etc.) can be found [here](http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/r302301611.html). The information in this description also comes from [here](http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/r302301611.html).
