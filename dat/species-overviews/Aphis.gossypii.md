## Cotton aphid <br><sup>*Aphis gossypii*</sup>

Melon aphids have been observed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world. In the United States it is most commonly a nuisance in southern states, though some years its reach spans the entirety of the continental US. The figure to the right shows several nymphs at varying stages of development as well as a dark, wingless form of the adult aphid.

**Life Cycle**
The melon aphid's life cycle varies depending on its latitude in the continental US. In the northern states female nymphs hatch from eggs in the spring after **overwintering as eggs**. However, in the south it is common to see **offspring produced** by mature aphids **year round**, assuming weather conditions allows for feeding and growth. Under cold conditions eggs are the only overwintering form, while warm conditions permit a melon aphid to complete its development and reproduction in [**about seven days**](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/aphid/melon_aphid.htm).
