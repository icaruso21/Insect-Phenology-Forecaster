## Khapra beetle <br><sup>*Trogoderma granarium*</sup>

The khapra beetle is one of the most concerning stored-product pests in the world. It is difficult to control _T. granarium_ infestations due in large part to the beetle's ability to survive extended periods without food and moisture. They are also known for their resistance to insecticides and fumigants, as the beetle frequently resides in small, inaccessible crevices for long periods of time. There are currently no ongoing infestations in the United States, but they have been found in California in the 1950s and in 2000 were considered one of the worst invasive species [in the world](http://www.issg.org/pdf/publications/worst_100/english_100_worst.pdf). It was estimated that [67% of the continental US](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/beetles/khapra_beetle.htm) would have been a suitable climate for _T. granarium_, had extensive and expensive eradication measures not been undertaken during much of the late 20th century.
