## Khapra beetle <br><sup>*Trogoderma granarium*</sup>

The khapra beetle is one of the most concerning stored-product pests in the world. It is difficult to control _T. granarium_ infestations due in large part to the beetle's ability to survive extended periods without food and moisture. They are also known for their resistance to insecticides and fumigants, as the beetle frequently resides in small, inaccessible crevices for long periods of time.
