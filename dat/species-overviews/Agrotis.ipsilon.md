## Black cutworm <br><sup>*Agrotis ipsilon*</sup>

The black cutworm has a wide feeding range, it is a pest of many economically important grains including corn, and nearly all vegetables. While the black cutworm is absent from some tropical and colder areas, it is found in many regions of the world including much of the United States and Canada. In North America, there are typically two to four generations of _Agrotis ipsilon_ each year, though this varies based on weather conditions. In Canada, colder temperatures mean only 1-2 generations reach adulthood each year.

Overwintering occurs in the pupal stage in most places, while larvae in Florda often continue development year round.
