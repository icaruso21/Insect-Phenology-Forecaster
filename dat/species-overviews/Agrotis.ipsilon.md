## Black cutworm <br><sup>*Agrotis ipsilon*</sup>

The black cutworm has a wide feeding range, it is a pest of many economically important grains including corn, and nearly all vegetables. While the black cutworm is absent from some tropical and colder areas, it is found in many regions of the world including much of the United States and Canada. In North America, there are typically one or two generations of _Agrotis ipsilon_ each year, though this varies based on weather conditions. 

More information about this species (life-cycle, management, etc.) can be found [here](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/aphid/melon_aphid.htm). The information and much of the text also comes from [here](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/aphid/melon_aphid.htm).
