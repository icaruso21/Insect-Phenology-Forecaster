## Codling moth <br><sup>*Cydia pomonella*</sup>

The codling moth is a widespread pest species found in nearly all temperate pome fruit-growing regions of the world. Completing *2-4 generations per year*, adults are present in many areas of North America from April through September. It is the most *widely distributed* and important pest of apple, pear, and walnuts in the world. It has also been found in many other hosts including the almond, apricot, fig, macadamia, nectarine, peach, plum, prune, and quince. More generally, fruits are known to carry this pest in trade/transport.

Females lay eggs on fruits, stems, or leaves of hosts. Larvae tunnel into fruit to feed on the seeds. Larval damage to fruit is characterized by entry and exit holes, rot that surrounds larval feeding areas, and frass accumulation. Mature larvae exit the fruit and create a cocoon under tree bark or in leaf litter; *overwintering occurs as a prepupa*.
