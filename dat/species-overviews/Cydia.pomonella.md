## Codling moth <br><sup>*Cydia pomonella*</sup>

**Biology** 
The codling moth is a widespread pest species commonly found in the continental United States. Completing 2-4 generations per year, adults are present in many areas of North America from April through September.

Females lay eggs on fruits, stems, or leaves of hosts. Larvae tunnel into fruit to feed on the seeds. Larval damage to fruit is characterized by entry and exit holes, rot that surrounds larval feeding areas, and frass accumulation. Mature larvae exit the fruit and create a cocoon under tree bark or in leaf litter; overwintering occurs as a prepupa.

Fruits are known to carry this pest in trade/transport.
