The Cabbage white butterfly completes a life cycle in three to six weeks, depending on environmental conditions. In the northeast, there are typically three generations reported, three to five in California, and six to eight in the south. These insects are known to reproduce year-round in Florida. The adult cabbage butterfly lives for approximately three weeks and females can produce up to 400 eggs. 

*P. Rapae* larvae feed on many common vegetable crops including broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard, horseradish, kale, and kohlrabi.
