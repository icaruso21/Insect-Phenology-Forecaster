## Pea aphid <br><sup>*Acyrthosiphon pisum*</sup>

The pea aphid is a model aphid species found in temperate climates worldwide. It feeds on nearly 20 genera in the family Fabacea, and notably is a major pest of peas, clovers, and alfalfa. _A. pisum_ was the [first basal hemimetabolous](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000007819) with a sequenced genome.

The life cycle of the pea aphid is **holocyclic**-- overwintering eggs hatch in the spring, followed by multiple asexually reproducing generations from spring to early autum when, in response to a decreasing **photoperiod** (day length) sexually reproducing males and females are spawned to lay durable overwintering eggs. In warmer climates with sufficient resources, including many regions in the Southern US, adult _A. pisum_ are able to continue asexual reproduction during the winter months.
